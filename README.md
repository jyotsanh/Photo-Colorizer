# Photo-Colorizer Project

This repository is for our college major project, which is a photo-colorizer that takes old black and white temple photos and colorizes them using generative AI.

## Team Members
- **Me** - Backend and AI Engineer
- **Nelson** - Frontend Engineer

## University
Lincoln University

## Current Status
We are currently conducting literature reviews and exploring DeOldify models, fine-tuning them for our specific purpose.

## Overview
The aim of this project is to revive historical and cultural heritage by bringing color to old black and white temple photos. By leveraging the capabilities of generative AI, specifically focusing on image-to-image translation models, we hope to produce visually appealing and historically accurate colorized images.

## Objectives
1. Conduct comprehensive literature reviews on existing image colorization techniques.
2. Seek and evaluate DeOldify and other image-to-image models.
3. Fine-tune selected models to enhance their performance on temple photos.
4. Develop a user-friendly frontend for users to upload and view colorized photos.

Stay tuned for updates as we progress with our project!
